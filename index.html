        <h2>National 5 or GCSE Physics</h2>
        <p>To achieve excellent exam results and to support more advanced studies, it's important to succeed in establishing excellent knowledge and skills at this foundation level. Most often students struggle because they lack key pieces of foundation knowledge or, for whatever reason, the classroom learning experience presents challenges. Targeted tuition can really make a difference to students at this level, develop confidence and ultimately improve exam outcomes.</p></div>

        <h2>Higher Physics</h2>
        <p>The Scottish Higher Physics course presents a challenge for many young people. It's a step change in complexity and workload from National 5 and, as this is delivered over 1 school year (9 months), it's vital that students keep up to date in this fast moving course. Tuition at this level would focus on building self belief and making sure a solid work ethic is in place, unpacking difficult curriculum areas, and ensuring students are getting plenty of practice explaining their knowldege and solving exam style problems.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Higher or A Level</h2>
        <p>Both the 1 year Advanced Higher Physics or the 2 year A Level Physics course are vital in demonstrating students' ability to work within a demanding curriculum which paves the way to university. There are plenty of conceptual challenges in these courses which require careful thinking; students must correctly understand and consolidate theory and then be able to express their knowledge through problem solving and calculation. I have taught both these courses and can help students through any challenges they may encounter.</p>

        <p class="lead">Robert Brice has 18 years classroom experience teaching all levels of the high school physics curriculum and is a Chartered Physics Teacher. He taught in James Gillespie's High School (JGHS), Edinburgh which regularly achieved excellent results in physics and is ranked highly in national league tables. He led the Advanced Higher Physics programme in JGHS, trained teachers in the Thinking Science cognitive acceleration programme, and was involved in several initiatives exploring using the use of digital technology in learning.</p>
        <p class="lead">Robert qualified as a teacher in 2000 at Edinburgh University following a successful career in renewable energy with BP in London and Sydney, and as a self employed energy and environmental consultant.</p>
        <p class="lead">In addition to his PGCE, Robert has a BSc (Hons) in Physics from St Andrews University and a Masters in Environmental Management (Distinction). His interests include sailing, playing guitar, cycling and sculpture.</p>

    <p class="lead fst-italic" style="padding-top:.75em; font-size: 1.75rem;">"I believe studying physics should not leave you frustrated, feeling that it's just too hard! It should open the door to a new world that stimulates your curiosity and helps you understand just about every aspect of our modern world."</p>

        <p class="lead">I am based in Edinburgh and, using zoom, I tutor students anywhere in the UK. Tutor support might involve providing additional physics lessons to help a student through the school year, or providing more focused assistance in an area that presents particular challenges. Whatever is required, we will typically start by having an in depth discussion to clarify in detail what the student needs and what support I will provide. We will also agree the number of tutorial sessions, fee and frequency of progress review meetings. This will all be summarised in a tutoring agreement which we will approve in advance of the first tutorial session. When we are happy, we'll get started.</p>

        <p class="lead">Learning how to do formula calculations is challenging and frustrating for many physics students; rearranging equations, substituting correctly, using the correct accuracy and units in answers are just some of the skills students need to master. When you unpack this important area you quickly see there's lots to get familiar with. I developed EquationLab to help students master equation skills and complete formula calculations quickly and easily.</p>
